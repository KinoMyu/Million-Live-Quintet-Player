# Million Live Quintet Player
Unit simulator for MLTD using the BASS audio library. HCA decryption code uses a modified version of https://github.com/Nyagamon/HCADecoder. Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eOz9x5wy3k.

# How to build
  1. Download dependencies from http://www.un4seen.com/ (bass, bassmix, and bass_fx).
  2. Place bass.h/lib, bassmix.h/lib, and bass_fx.h/lib in bass/.
  3. Open QuintetPlayer.pro in Qt Studio and build.

This program is technically cross-platform, but has only been tested on Windows, so YMMV.

# How to obtain resource files
Download release version of Quintet Player or rip .hca files directly from MLTD.
